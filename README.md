## Anatomy of the Product View Component

The component has 4 files: component files, view file, hook file, and index file.

- Component Files (product-view.component.jsx and product-view.css)

  - These files house the product view component its self. From the JSX structure to styling.

- Hook File (product-view.hook.jsx)

  - This file contains all of the logic needed in the product view component. In essence, incrementing/decrementing the product count, selecting a variant and adding to cart or buying the product.

- View File (product-view.view.jsx)

  - This file is contains the UI and renders based on state and responds based on the actions provided.

- Index File (index.jsx)

  - This file is the bridge for both the component and logic.
